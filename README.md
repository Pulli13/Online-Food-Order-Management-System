I made this project using Java, JSP, JDBC and Tomcat Server

You first need to install and configure following requirements:
1.Java Development Kit (JDK): You need to have JDK installed on your system in order to compile and run Java code, including JSP pages. You can download the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website.

2.Eclipse IDE: You need to have Eclipse IDE installed on your system to write, compile, and run JSP pages. You can download the latest version of Eclipse from the official website.

3. Tomcat Server: You need to have a web server installed on your system to run JSP pages. Tomcat is a popular web server that supports JSP pages. You can download the latest version of Tomcat from the Apache website.

4.JDBC Driver: You need to have a JDBC driver installed on your system to connect to a database from your JSP page. The JDBC driver depends on the database you are using. You can download the JDBC driver from the database vendor's website.

5.JSTL Library: You need to have the JSTL library installed on your system to use JSTL tags in your JSP page. You can download the JSTL library from the official website.
        
After installing and configuring the above requirements, Start the Tomcat Server then
you have 2 options to proceed further:
1st option: either reset you mySQL workbench password to MySQL@411681 (b/c in all files this password is used).
2nd option: manually go to each connection in each file and write your existing mySQL workbench password( it is very time consuming process and might throw error if you skip, even a single connection so i suggest to avoid it).
Now we can run our application using 2 options:

1st option: open first.jsp and right click-> Run as -> Run On Server.
 
2nd option:
Copy paste below link in search bar of your browser
localhost:8080/Complete_Delivery_Management/first.jsp
If it's not working, itâ€™s probably because the port number is different in your machine, like it may be 8081, in that case replace 8080 with 8081 in the above link.
